# C-printf

## Objetives
The main objective of this repository is to create the printf program from zero,
for which we will follow various tasks step by step.
This is a group assignment for the Holberton School Foundations course.

### Members:
* Luis Escobedo
* Ronald Altamirano

## Tasks:

### 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to.
Write a function that produces output according to a format.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives.
See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
* c
* s
* %

### 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
* d
* i
* You dont have to handle the flag characters
* You dont have to handle field width
* You dont have to handle precision
* You dont have to handle the length modifiers

### 2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
Create a man page for your function.
